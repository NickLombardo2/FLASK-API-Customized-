# FLASK-API-Customized-
use https://www.npoint.io/docs/7355cdcb6317e77351e3 to create your own JSON data to create a blog by using the virtual enviroment http address/blog/1 for example 
this program works by running the http://127.0.0.1:5000/<variable>
 in this case the first file path is http://127.0.0.1:5000/guess/<variable> in this case you place a name for the variable and the API call will guess your age and gender 
  in the second case the  file path is http://127.0.0.1:5000/blog/<variable> in this case you place a number for the variable and the API call will call your JSON data from the website. In this case when I put in the ID number in the file path (1) for example it will pull from my JSON data with id:1 or simply press the blog file path to see your blog
