# FLASK-API-Customized-
use https://www.npoint.io/docs/7355cdcb6317e77351e3 to create your own JSON data.



1 way to run it is the venv http path followed by http:..../guess/variable this is asking for you to type in a name and the API calls will guess gender and age.


second way to run is http.../blog/variable in this programs case you would put numbers 1 through 3 in the variable and API call will return my JSON data from npoint.
